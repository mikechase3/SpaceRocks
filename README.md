## Acknowledgments

This project is heavily inspired and built upon the concepts and frameworks presented in Chris Bradfield's *Godot 4 Game Development Projects*. Most of the core game mechanics and project structure come from this source, with several custom modifications to enhance gameplay and aesthetics.

I would like to thank Dr. Nicholas Stiffler for his invaluable class materials and guidance throughout this project, which provided the foundation to apply what I learned effectively.
